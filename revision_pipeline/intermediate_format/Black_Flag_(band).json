Black Flag, Husker Du, and Minutemen were a part of something much bigger than hardcore (which, like its parent punk, just became a generic brand name for unoriginal music.)  Everyone knows Black Flag pioneered hardcore music, that's why hardcore punk should remain, but they did so much more after that.  That's what's misleading.

Yes, many sources talk about how the band moved further and further from hardcore over the course of their career, from the sludge-y B-side of ''My War'' all the way through the instrumental jams and spoken word etc., and some sources note their influence on other fusion genres/subgenres. But in my reading of a number of sources none of them actually placed Black Flag themselves in any specific genres that weren't some variation of punk rock. And of course the term \"alternative metal\" didn't come along for well over a decade after Black Flag's breakup. Of course if you want to build a \"Style\" section in the article and draw from different sources describing the band's musical evolution (and cite them, of course), that'd be fantastic. The infobox is supposed to summarize details from the article itself, so as long as the infobox reflects the (referenced) content of the article body, I'd be satisfied. Ultimately it's up to the sources and what they say. --[[User:IllaZilla|IllaZilla]] ([[User talk:IllaZilla|talk]]) 03:50, 10 December 2010 (UTC)", "timestamp": "2010-12-10T03:50:10Z", "user": "IllaZilla", "ingested": true, "revisions": [401564695], "reply_chain": ["916cd97cc01604b076d239a5544ebe3e", "3a4802a8a42410c9eda6c93e3476f060"], "is_followed": false}, "7f91e3df41e09782591730c9301c381b": {"text": "== One user completely removed \"External links\" section ==", "timestamp": "2011-01-08T06:04:57Z", "user": "Oakshade", "ingested": true, "revisions": [406634857], "reply_chain": ["7f91e3df41e09782591730c9301c381b"], "is_followed": true}, "7606c462856c7046ce3528e8fce66c09": {"text": "A user a chosen to remove the entire \"External links\" section with the edit summary: lacking an external links section\" is not a bad thing.

Same with the interviews: if they're reliable and provice meaningful content about the band's writing/philosophy/work ethic (which are topics touched on in the article), then they should be used as sources & not as external links (points 1 & 3 again). The value of the fansite depends on its reliability and how much in-depth content it includes that goes beyond the scope of Wikipedia or the article's cited sources.

The fansite linked, for example, seems to have a number of copyrighted images of the band that they have permission to display, but that Wikipedia wouldn't have permission to use, so that's a good reason to keep it. As for the interviews, I'd really rather see them used as sources to enhance the content of the article. I've encountered too many band articles with EL sections that are just long lists of interviews, few of which have any information in them that shouldn't be used in the article body or that isn't already covered by secondary sources.

This is supported by WP:EL: \"If the website or page to which you want to link includes information that is not yet a part of the article, consider using it as a source for the article, and citing it.\" As I asked earlier, what makes these interviews unable to be used as sources (thus justifying putting them in an EL section instead)? If, as you said earlier, they contain relevant info about the band's style/work ethic, etc., shouldn't we quote or paraphrase something from them in the article body & then link them via citations? That would seem a better way to use these to improve the article. Also as I've asked before, please drop the ''ad hominem'' accusations of ownership. I've still only made 1 edit to the article during this entire exchange, so that accusation is unfounded.

To understand Black Flag or anything else from the past, one must begin with \"primary sources\" - here, that would be band members, their friends, and people who participated in that scene. For that reason, I think there is an over-reliance on the Allmusic website or Rolling Stone rock history articles, which are retrospective, and a lack of reviews from that time. Also, I would suggest deleting most of the references to, and summaries of, Azerrad's \"Our Band Could Be Your Life.\" While that book is good for its use of contemporary sources (same time as Black Flag were playing), it is terrible in that it applies a marketing perspective, and MBA/commericialism perspective that is very much at odds with both the goals and values of many of the band members, and also very much at odds with the values and perspective of the Black Flag audience of the 80s. A much better source is Stevie Chick's \"Spray Paint the Walls,\" because Chick was a participant in that scene, and understands the band the way they understood themselves.
