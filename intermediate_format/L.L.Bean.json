The two dates mentioned for the blue laws, the funeral of the founder and that store got evacuated due to a fire next door in late 80's.  Tried to find a reference to the last two but all I found was just mentions in passing.  maybe someone else can look at this.  Thanks.  --[[Special:Contributions/12.152.0.169|12.152.0.169]] ([[User talk:12.152.0.169|talk]]) 02:33, 25 November 2010 (UTC)", "timestamp": "2010-11-25T02:33:57Z", "user": "12.152.0.169", "ingested": true, "revisions": [398739340, 398739399], "reply_chain": ["9c163204b3b76b3e082c615010c86608", "a4dada0a1d8517d42984fbca5c08a2cb"], "is_followed": false}, "8e834af43739e39fd0a8f2b3eba63aee": {"text": "== Company name (again) ==", "timestamp": "2011-11-29T10:12:50Z", "user": "Cheng", "ingested": true, "revisions": [463085881], "reply_chain": ["8e834af43739e39fd0a8f2b3eba63aee"], "is_followed": true}, "d9da230ac9816d779dd3e65ccd51687f": {"text": "* Legal name registered to the Secretary of State of Maine: '''L.

Additionally, Wiki editors have not allowed negative impacts from Trump's attacks on a company/corporate page,therefore, any negative impacts from attacking through Trump should not be included.

However, actual effects as noted in the NYT source, that happened to [[Lockheed Martin]] and [[General Motors]] are noticeably absent from their pages.
